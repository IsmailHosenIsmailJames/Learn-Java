         * Here a list of all kinds of operators in Java:
         * 
         * 1. Arithmetic Operators:
         *    - `+` (addition)
         *    - `-` (subtraction)
         *    - `*` (multiplication)
         *    - `/` (division)
         *    - `%` (modulus)
         * 
         * 2. Relational Operators:
         *    - `==` (equal to)
         *    - `!=` (not equal to)
         *    - `<` (less than)
         *    - `>` (greater than)
         *    - `<=` (less than or equal to)
         *    - `>=` (greater than or equal to)
         * 
         * 3. Logical Operators:
         *    - `&&` (logical AND)
         *    - `||` (logical OR)
         *    - `!` (logical NOT)
         * 4. Bitwise Operators:
         *    - `&` (bitwise AND)
         *    - `|` (bitwise OR)
         *    - `^` (bitwise XOR)
         *    - `~` (bitwise NOT)
         *    - `<<` (left shift)
         *    - `>>` (right shift)
         *    - `>>>` (unsigned right shift)
         * 
         * 5. Assignment Operators:
         *    - `=` (assignment)
         *    - `+=` (addition assignment)
         *    - `-=` (subtraction assignment)
         *    - `*=` (multiplication assignment)
         *    - `/=` (division assignment)
         *    - `%=` (modulus assignment)
         *    - `&=` (bitwise AND assignment)
         *    - `|=` (bitwise OR assignment)
         *    - `^=` (bitwise XOR assignment)
         *    - `<<=` (left shift assignment)
         *    - `>>=` (right shift assignment)
         *    - `>>>=` (unsigned right shift assignment)
         * 
         * 6. Increment and Decrement Operators:
         *    - `++` (increment)
         *    - `--` (decrement)
         * 
         * 7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
         *    - `? :` (conditional or ternary operator)
         * 
         * 8. instanceof Operator:
         *    - `instanceof` (used for type checking)
         * 
         * 9. Type Cast Operator:
         *    - `(type)` (used for type casting)
         * 
         * 10. Member Access Operators:
         *     - `.` (dot operator, for accessing class members)
         *     - `->` (arrow operator, for accessing instance members in lambda expressions)
         * 
         * 11. Array Access Operator:
         *     - `[]` (square brackets, for accessing array elements)
         * 
         * 12. String Concatenation Operator:
         *     - `+` (for concatenating strings)
